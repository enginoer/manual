# Welcome to the EnginOER Manual

Open educational resources (OER) are great. They are even better when easy to reuse and improve! EnginOER was created by Robert Lanzafame to make that process better, particularly for:
- teachers in engineering and applied sciences fields, especially those that have little time to learn new tools,
- materials that can be written as text-based files in any text editing software but can be richly formatted and shared online,
- materials that often include programming and computation.

This manual was started in early 2025 by Robert Lanzafame as a place to share useful information about open educational resources (OER). In particular, it will try to:
1. Explain how text files can be used to create richly formatted documents that can be shared online.
2. 

Robert is a civil engineer, but this should be relevant for many fields, especially those that rely heavily on physics and programming.
